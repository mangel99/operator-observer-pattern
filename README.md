## Overview
The **Operator–Observer Pattern** is an original architectural pattern designed for AI-driven systems that operate generative pipelines.  
It introduces **dual-context supervision** where:

- **App-Context**: the state, artifacts, and metrics of the specific task (e.g., app build).  
- **Motor-Context**: the rules, templates, and validators of the underlying factory/platform.  
- **Observers**: agents that capture signals from both contexts.  
- **Operator**: a supervisory agent that arbitrates issues, deciding whether to patch the app, the motor, or both.  

This allows AI systems to **pause, patch, resume**, and **self-improve** their own execution environment.
