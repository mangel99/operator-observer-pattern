## Abstract
This paper introduces the **Operator–Observer Pattern**, an original architectural pattern designed for AI-driven systems that operate generative pipelines. Unlike classical design patterns (e.g., the GoF Observer), this pattern addresses dual-context supervision, allowing AI agents to not only solve task-specific (app-level) problems but also detect and improve systemic (motor-level) flaws. The Operator–Observer Pattern provides a structured approach for observation, classification, arbitration, and sel...

## 1. Introduction
AI factories and generative pipelines face a recurring challenge: distinguishing whether errors arise from the application being built or from systemic flaws in the underlying platform. Traditional patterns such as **Observer** and **Mediator** address notification and coordination but do not provide mechanisms for arbitration across dual contexts.  

The Operator–Observer Pattern extends these ideas by introducing a supervisory operator capable of classifying and acting upon both app-level and motor-level issues, ensuring resilience and continuous improvement.

---

## 2. Pattern Definition
The Operator–Observer Pattern introduces a dual-context supervision mechanism consisting of four roles:

- **App-Context**: the state, artifacts, and metrics of the task or app being built.  
- **Motor-Context**: the rules, templates, and validators of the underlying factory or platform.  
- **Observers**: specialized agents that collect signals from both contexts.  
- **Operator**: a supervisory agent that consumes observer signals, classifies failures, and decides whether to patch the app, patch the motor, or both.  

This arbitration enables resumability: the pipeline can pause, patch, validate, and resume from checkpoints without restarting. Furthermore, motor-level fixes are consolidated, creating a learning loop that improves future runs.

---

## 3. Normative Requirements
The pattern specifies RFC-style normative requirements:

- Contexts **MUST** be separated and versioned.  
- Observers **MUST** emit structured events including scope, type, severity, and payload.  
- The Operator **MUST** classify incidents using a defined taxonomy (App, Motor, Mixed).  
- Pipelines **MUST** support pause, patch, validate, and resume operations.  
- Motor fixes **MUST** be logged and versioned, feeding a continuous improvement loop.  
- Safety gates and rollback mechanisms **MUST** be enforced for motor changes.  

---

## 4. Error Taxonomy
The pattern defines a minimal error taxonomy:

- **APP-SPEC**: specification errors such as missing fields or invalid mappings.  
- **APP-BUILD**: build errors such as broken dependencies or compilation failures.  
- **MOTOR-RULES**: systemic flaws in validators or templates.  
- **MOTOR-PERF**: performance or cost issues caused by the motor.  
- **MIXED-DRIFT**: misalignment between app expectations and motor version.  

---

## 5. Lifecycle and Heuristics
The Operator–Observer Pattern defines a lifecycle for execution:

```
IDLE → RUNNING → PAUSED → PATCHING (Motor or App) → VALIDATING → RESUMING → RUNNING → (SUCCESS or FAILED)
```

**Decision heuristics** guide arbitration:  
- Repeated failures across apps suggest motor issues.  
- Profile-specific failures indicate app issues.  
- Quality regressions with motor upgrades signal **mixed drift** requiring systemic attention.  

---

## 6. Example Flow
**Example execution:**

1. An observer detects a validation error in an app run.  
2. The operator finds similar incidents across multiple apps and classifies it as **MOTOR-RULES**.  
3. The motor is patched, validated, and version bumped.  
4. The app resumes from its checkpoint and completes successfully.  
5. The fix is logged and contributes to long-term motor improvement.

## 7. Related Work
The Operator–Observer Pattern extends ideas from the classical **Observer** and **Mediator** patterns, as well as **supervisory control** in control theory. However, it is distinct in addressing dual contexts (app vs. motor) and incorporating self-improvement as a first-class concern.  

It also overlaps with **AIOps** approaches but formalizes arbitration and dual-context separation as explicit architectural concerns.

## 8. Contributions
This work makes several contributions:

- Defines the Operator–Observer Pattern as a novel AI architectural pattern.  
- Introduces dual-context supervision and arbitration as first-class concepts.  
- Provides a normative framework (requirements, taxonomy, lifecycle) for implementation.  
- Demonstrates applicability to AI factories and multi-agent orchestration frameworks.  

---

## 9. Future Work
Future directions for research and application include:

- Empirical evaluation in large-scale multi-agent systems.  
- Integration with existing MLOps and LLMOps platforms.  
- Formal verification of arbitration logic.  
- Extending the taxonomy to cover additional AI reliability concerns (e.g., fairness, bias drift).  

---

## 10. Conclusion
The Operator–Observer Pattern offers a structured approach for AI orchestration in generative factories. By introducing dual-context supervision and a feedback-driven learning loop, it enables resilient, self-improving systems.  

We propose this pattern as a contribution to the catalog of emerging AI patterns and recommend further evaluation through implementation in multi-agent orchestration frameworks.
